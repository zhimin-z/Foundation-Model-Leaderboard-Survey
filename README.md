## Overview
The paper investigates various foundation model (FM) leaderboards across multiple platforms, focusing on their types, workflows, and operational issues or "smells". We also curate an awesome list of ML leaderboards, check [here](https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards).

## Contents
1. **Code**: This repository includes scripts to analyze metadata from FM leaderboards.
2. **Data**: This repository includes collected metadata from FM leaderboards.
3. **Results**: This repository includes results of analyses on FM leaderboards.
