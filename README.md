This repository contains the datasets, code, and additional resources used in "An Exploratory Study on the Operations and Smells of Foundation Model Leaderboards" by Zhimin Zhao et al. The paper investigates various leaderboard systems across multiple platforms, focusing on their characteristics, operations, and smells prevalent in foundation model leaderboards.

## Overview
The study systematically explores the architecture of leaderboard systems, identifying key components and operational patterns that enhance or hinder the effectiveness of FMs in various evaluation contexts. It introduces the concept of LBOps (Leaderboard Operations), which includes methodologies and practices critical for managing and optimizing leaderboard systems.

## Contents
1. **Code**: Includes scripts used for collecting and analyzing data from leaderboard systems.
2. **Data**: This section hosts the collected data from over 439 distinct leaderboard systems.
