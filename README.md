## Overview
Our paper investigates various foundation model (FM) leaderboards across multiple platforms, focusing on their types, operational workflows ("**LBOps**"), and issues ("**leaderboard smells**"). We also curate an awesome list of FM leaderboards, check [here](https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards).

## Contents
1. **Code**: Contains scripts for analyzing metadata from FM leaderboards.  
2. **Data**: Stores collected metadata from FM leaderboards.  
3. **Results**: Includes analysis results and graphs related to FM leaderboards. Notably, *Foundation Model Leaderboards.xlsx* provides all the necessary labels used throughout our studies.  
4. **Talk**: Features transcripts (in both English and Chinese) from a discussion with a leading expert in leaderboard operations.
