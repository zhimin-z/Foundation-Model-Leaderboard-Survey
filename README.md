## Overview
Our paper investigates various foundation model (FM) leaderboards across multiple platforms, focusing on their operational workflows ("**LBOps**"), and common pitfalls ("**leaderboard smells**"). We also curate an awesome list of FM leaderboards, check [here](https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards).

## Contents
1. **requirements.txt**: Lists all the necessary libraries required to run the script. Use this file to install dependencies with a package manager like pip.

2. **README.md**: Provides comprehensive documentation for the replication package, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.

3. **code/main.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the core script of our study, including data processing, analysis, and visualization steps.

4. **data/Dependents_Lookup.sh**: Bash script used for mining GitHub repositories. It automates the process of retrieving repository information.

5. **data/GitHub.json**: Stores metadata about the GitHub repositories mined during our study, including relevant details for analysis.

6. **data/HuggingFace.json**: Contains the URLs of all the mined Hugging Face spaces, facilitating further exploration and analysis of foundation models.

7. **data/PapersWithCode.json**: Stores URLs of the mined leaderboards from Papers with Code, supporting our study on benchmarking efforts.

8. **result/Foundation Model Leaderboards.xlsx**: Spreadsheet containing all the labels and relevant information extracted for the foundation model leaderboards analyzed in our research.

9. **result/Leaderboard-Distribution.pdf**: Visual representation of the distribution of leaderboards across various platforms, summarizing the findings of our study.
