## Overview
Our paper investigates various foundation model (FM) leaderboards across multiple platforms, focusing on their operational workflows ("**LBOps**"), and common pitfalls ("**leaderboard smells**"). We also curate an awesome list of FM leaderboards, check [here](https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards).

## Contents

1. **requirements.txt**: Lists the libraries needed to run the scripts. Use it to install dependencies via a package manager like `pip`.

2. **code/main.ipynb**: The primary notebook for the study, covering data collection, analysis, and visualization.

3. **data/Dependents_Lookup.sh**: A bash script for automating the mining of GitHub repositories and retrieving repository metadata.

4. **data/GitHub.json**: Contains the URLs of GitHub repositories mined during the study.

5. **data/HuggingFace.json**: Contains the URLs of Hugging Face spaces mined during the study.

6. **data/PapersWithCode.json**: Contains the URLs of Papers with Code leaderboards mined during the study.

7. **result/Foundation Model Leaderboards.xlsx**: Includes metadata, labels, and URLs for foundation model leaderboards identified during the study.

8. **result/Leaderboard-Distribution.pdf**: A visual representation of the distribution of leaderboards across different sources.
